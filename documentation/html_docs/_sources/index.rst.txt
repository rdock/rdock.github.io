|Dock|: a fast, versatile, and open-source program for docking ligands to proteins and nucleic acids
====================================================================================================

|Dock| is a fast and versatile **open-source docking program** that can be used
to dock **small molecules** against **proteins** and **nucleic acids**. It is
designed for high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) campaigns and binding mode
prediction studies.

|Dock| is mainly written in C++ and accessory scripts and programs are written in
C++, Perl or Python languages.

The full |Dock| software package requires **less than 50 MB** of hard disk space
and it is compilable (at this moment, **only**) in **all Linux computers**.

Thanks to its design and implementation [rDock2014]_, it can be installed on a
computation cluster and deployed on an **unlimited number of CPUs**, allowing
HTVS campaigns to be carried out in a **matter of days**.

Besides its main Docking program, the |Dock| software package also provides a set
of tools and scripts to facilitate **preparation** of the input files and
**post-processing** and **analysis** of results.

   The above image illustrates the first binding mode solution for ASTEX system
   1hwi, with an RMSD of 0.88 Å.

Docking preparation
   Define cavities using **known binders** or with user-supplied **3D
   coordinates**. Allow -OH and -NH2 receptor side chains to rotate. Add
   explicit solvent molecules and structural waters. Supply pharmacophoric
   restraints as a bias to **guide docking**.

Pre-processing of input files
   Define common ligand structure for performing **tethered docking** (requires
   Open Babel Python bindings). Sort, filter or split ligand files for
   facilitating **parallelization**. Find **HTVS protocol** for optimizing
   calculation time. Pre-calculate grids to decrease subsequent calculation
   times.

Post-processing and analysis of results
   Summarize results in a tabular format. Sort, filter, merge or split results
   files. Calculate **RMSD** with a reference structure taking into account
   internal symmetries (requires Open Babel Python bindings).

Binding mode prediction
   Predict how a ligand will bind to a given molecule. The ASTEX non-redundant
   test set for proteins and DOCK and |Dock| test sets for RNA have been used for
   validating and comparing |Dock| with other programs.

High-throughput virtual screening
   Run for million of compounds in short time by exploiting the capabilities of
   computer calculation farms. Ease of **parallelization** in relatively
   unlimited CPUs to optimize HTVS running times. The DUD set has been used for
   validating |Dock| and comparing its performance to other reference docking
   programs.

History
^^^^^^^

The RiboDock program was developed from 1998 to 2006 by the software team at
RiboTargets (subsequently `Vernalis (R&D) Ltd <https://www.vernalis.com/>`__)
[RiboDock2004]_. In 2006, the software was licensed to the `University of York
<http://www.ysbl.york.ac.uk/>`__ for maintenance and distribution under the
name rDock.

In 2012, Vernalis and the University of York agreed to release the program as
open-source software [rDock2014]_. This version is developed with support from
the `University of Barcelona <http://www.ub.edu/cbdd/>`__ --
`github.com/cbdd/rdock <https://github.com/cbdd/rdock/>`__.
